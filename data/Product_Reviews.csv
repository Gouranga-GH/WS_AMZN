High quality, heavy featured , big storage high performance phone in budget price

High performance, heavily featured 5G smart phone much better than the high priced premium phones. Fast charging( 67 watts charger included). RF blaster works very well. Good battery- lasts for 2 days in normal usage. Good sound quality and good camera. Extremely happy to have it

Pretty good phone for the price
","
The performance is very good, it can emulate Pok√©mon X with very minimal stutters and CODM runs quite well too judging by the few games that I‚Äôve played. It‚Äôs not very heavy so it‚Äôs not too unwieldy but it‚Äôs size does cause issues as it‚Äôs too large to use one handed, it‚Äôll take some time to get used to since my last phone was a tiny iPhone 6.I don‚Äôt particularly care about photo quality so I don‚Äôt have much to say but I think the camera is quite good, definitely good enough for stuff like sending homework to friends and whatnot.The phone on Miui 14 did not heat up a lot while emulating Pokemon X but after upgrading to HyperOS it has started heating up enough to make my hands a little sweaty after an hour of playing and I‚Äôve also noticed more stutters and fps drops, not just in game but also in daily tasks like accessing the Notification Centre and the widgets area. So wouldn‚Äôt recommend upgrading to HyperOS rn as it seems to be poorly optimised, this is why I‚Äôm removing a star from the review.The battery life is good enough to not cause any issues in day to day use, the fast charging is quite, well, fast, it can charge up from 20 to 100 in less than an hour. The headphone jack is quite convenient to have since I don‚Äôt have to use a dongle to connect my headphones to the phone but it‚Äôs placement is rather annoying as it causes the upper part of the phone to become a little heavier.The phone did arrive with a LOT of bloatware tho, I‚Äôd recommend removing everything unnecessary using a software called Universal Android Debloater which is available on GitHub, but only do this after researching what is safe is remove and what isn‚Äôt as it‚Äôs easy to brick the phone by carelessly removing apps using UAD.TLDR : It‚Äôs a good phone in terms of emulation performance and battery life, on Miui 14 I did not notice any major performance issues or excessive heating but in HyperOS that changed and performance has decreased a little and the phone has started heating up faster.

Very bad phone and amazon service also.
","
Why I am saying this phone is very bad and the service of Amazon is also very bad because I purchased it 2 days ago and my realise that this mobile has not a better camera so I wanted to return this mobile but they told returning policy doesn't exist. And amazon service said to me, talk to poco service if they agree to return then I will. So I made a call to poco website (no. is given by amazon customer service) and they told. There is not returning policy of poco brand's mobile. If amazon want then you can return. Now you say friends what to do?  I am connected with amazon at least 8 years. But this type of thing will be happened to me, was unexpected.  Now, I will never purchase any item from amazon. Shame on you amazon.

It's the best all rounder in this price range. It's not a gaming phone...it's best for content consuming and the 3.5mm with Dolby Atmos is the best..if hear alot of music via wired earphones it's the best.... battery last for one day. Sound quality is the best camera quality and performance is average. You're not a gamer and don't take alot of pic..this is the prefect phone for you...and hyperOS have a little bug here and there ..

Best performing but Slow charging and battery drain
","
Pros: budget friendly best performing device, slim nd sleak design with premium plastic back, punchy (colourful) & bright display, camera is best performing in daylight and outdoors and average in indoor and night and telemacro lens was useless, dual app support was fine, good network connectivity (Jio), good rigid back case.Cons: *no expandable memory slot*Performing of camera in night was poorSlow charging: it takes 40-50 minutes to full charge, which is okay for 67-watt charge. But (If we use the handset while charging) it can take 1.5 - 2 hours for full charge. according to accubattery it can charge upto speed of  33watts as peak and mostly 480 Mah/hr speed (measured while using the handset)Battery Drain: mobile can withstand upto 12-24hrs fr regular use and 4-5 hrs fr heavy use such as gaming and noted no heating issue (only warmness noted while gaming & charging the handset)

Not bad not best. I am using this mobile since 15 days. All functions are good but battery back up is very poor. One day battery back in normal use. I am not playing games at all but battery is drawing very quickly. Slightly heating issue during call, charging and long use of internet. Display is quite good but not best.

Most value for money device but read full review first before buying.
","
To cut it short  -1) It has been the most value for money mobile in around 18k (after discount) .2) Remember - turn on fast charging from setting otherwise your mobile will take 33w only not 67 , i didnt knew at first and thought it is charging slow lol.3) On heavy  normal usage ( i dont do gaming) it lasts around 7 hrs on performance mode.4) Display is mind blowing ( no hdr but whos gonna play it anyway)5) i dont care about camera that much but it take fine images.6) Strictly not for heavy gamers.7) Hyperos is actually better and smoother.8) turn to normal mode from performance mode if you face heating issues.Verdict - for a regular user who takes calls, uses social media watch movies it is perfect phone.**I will update after  3 months usage

Expect better optimization on further updates
","
Performance wise good. Battery drain bit faster, Battery to be optimized. Heat issue on first 2 days after that not found any heat issue. Camera average. Excellent display. 5G speed average. HyperOS user friendly but with some bugs & battery optimization required. Fast charging good full charge in 45 to 50 mins. Speakers were OK not best. No return policy is always a worst concept for whatever products we purchase. Highly recommended based on this budget

Who should buy or avoid it?

The POCO X6 5G is a mid-range smartphone that aims to deliver a flagship experience on a budget. Here's a breakdown of its pros and cons:Pros:Impressive Display: The 6.67-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 1.5K resolution provides smooth scrolling and vibrant visuals, making it a standout feature in this price segment.Powerful Performance: The Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset, coupled with 12GB RAM, handles everyday tasks, multitasking, and even gaming with ease.Ample Storage: The 512GB storage option ensures you have plenty of space for apps, photos, and videos.Long-lasting Battery: The 5100mAh battery offers excellent longevity, easily lasting a full day on moderate usage.Fast Charging: The included 67W charger juices up the battery rapidly, reaching a significant charge in just minutes.Feature-rich: The phone includes stereo speakers, an IR blaster, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and expandable storage via microSD.Software Experience: MIUI 14 based on Android 13 offers a feature-rich and customizable software experience.Cons:Camera Performance: While the 64MP main camera with OIS takes decent photos in good lighting, low-light performance could be better. The ultrawide and macro cameras are average.Build Quality: The plastic build, while not a dealbreaker, feels less premium than glass or metal alternatives.Bloatware: MIUI 14 comes with some pre-installed apps that some users might find unnecessary.Software Updates: POCO's track record with software updates isn't the best, so long-term support might be a concern.Overall:The POCO X6 5G offers exceptional value for its price, boasting a stunning display, powerful performance, and long-lasting battery life. While the camera and build quality could be improved, its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses, making it an excellent choice for budget-conscious consumers looking for a high-performing and feature-rich smartphone.Who should buy it?Those who prioritize display quality and performance.Users who need a long-lasting battery with fast charging.Anyone looking for a feature-packed phone on a budget.Who should avoid it?Photography enthusiasts who demand top-notch low-light camera performance.Users who prefer a more premium build material.Those who dislike heavily customized Android skins and prefer a cleaner software experience.

I have been using various mobiles from apple 14 plus to samsung s22 ultra, I needed a spare phone which can perform well so I decided to go with Poco X6, my reviews for the sameProsExcellent battery backup, though fast charger takes 40 -50 mins to charge fully.The phone is very smooth to use, and i haven't had any heating issue.The 5g connectivity and wifi connectivity is solid and no drop till now (using airtel and jio sim)The performance works very fast for your basic usage.Camera is just above average, the main 64MP is good at daylight.ConsCamera could have been better, there is a night mode but yet no justification done, it's okay for the price range but that could have helped to get an edge over the competitors.Not for gamers, though it can handle games, we can clearly see a throttle and lag while playing higher end graphical games.Phones comes with MIUI interface but can be updated immediately to Hyper OS.It has only IP54 rating, so keep it carefully from hard water splashes.Final verdict : An excellent choice at this price range comapred to Vivo and Oppo for office use, networking and daily use.Will update after a months usage.
